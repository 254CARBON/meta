## Concepts

### AI Agent

An **AI agent** is an autonomous system that can perform operations on the platform without human intervention. Agents are designed to:

- Understand platform context and constraints
- Perform safe operations within defined boundaries
- Provide detailed audit trails of all actions
- Escalate issues that require human intervention

### Key Components

- **Agent Context**: Comprehensive platform state and constraints
- **Safe Operations**: Predefined operations that agents can perform
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluation of operation safety and impact
- **Audit Logging**: Complete trail of all agent actions
- **Escalation**: Mechanism for human intervention when needed

### Agent Types

| Type | Description | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Catalog Agent** | Manages service catalog operations | Update manifests, validate entries |
| **Quality Agent** | Monitors and improves quality metrics | Run tests, update coverage |
| **Drift Agent** | Detects and resolves drift issues | Update versions, fix dependencies |
| **Release Agent** | Manages release operations | Plan releases, execute rollbacks |
| **Security Agent** | Monitors security compliance | Scan vulnerabilities, update policies |

## Agent Context System

### Global Context Bundle

The global context bundle provides agents with comprehensive platform information:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "generated_at": "2025-01-27T10:30:00Z",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "agent_guidelines_version": "1.2.0"
  },
  "platform_state": {
    "total_services": 45,
    "active_services": 42,
    "health_status": "healthy",
    "last_catalog_update": "2025-01-27T09:15:00Z"
  },
  "service_catalog": {
    "services": [...],
    "domains": [...],
    "dependencies": [...]
  },
  "quality_metrics": {
    "average_score": 85.2,
    "services_below_threshold": ["service-a", "service-b"],
    "coverage_trends": [...]
  },
  "drift_status": {
    "total_issues": 3,
    "high_severity": 1,
    "recent_drift": [...]
  },
  "release_trains": {
    "active_trains": 2,
    "recent_releases": [...]
  },
  "risk_cues": {
    "high_risk_services": ["service-a", "service-b"],
    "low_coverage_services": ["service-c"],
    "spec_lag_services": ["service-d"]
  },
  "safe_operations": {
    "allowed_operations": [...],
    "forbidden_operations": [...],
    "escalation_triggers": [...]
  }
}
```

### Context Generation

The agent context is generated using:

```bash
python scripts/generate_agent_context.py --output-file ai/global-context/agent-context.json
```

### Context Updates

Context is automatically updated when:

- Service catalog changes
- Quality metrics are computed
- Drift detection runs
- Release trains are executed
- Security scans complete

## Safe Operations Framework

### Operation Categories

#### Safe Operations (Automated)

These operations can be performed autonomously:

- **Minor Version Updates**: Update patch versions
- **Dependency Updates**: Update non-breaking dependencies
- **Quality Improvements**: Add tests, fix linting issues
- **Documentation Updates**: Update README, comments
- **Configuration Tweaks**: Adjust non-critical settings

#### Escalation Required (Semi-Automated)

These operations require human approval:

- **Major Version Updates**: Breaking changes
- **Schema Changes**: API or data schema modifications
- **Security Policy Changes**: Security configuration updates
- **Infrastructure Changes**: Deployment configuration changes
- **Cross-Service Changes**: Changes affecting multiple services

#### Forbidden Operations (Manual Only)

These operations must be performed manually:

- **Production Deployments**: Direct production changes
- **Database Migrations**: Data structure changes
- **Security Policy Creation**: New security policies
- **User Access Changes**: Permission modifications
- **Critical System Changes**: Core platform modifications

### Operation Safety Evaluation

Each operation is evaluated for safety:

```python
def evaluate_operation_safety(operation, context):
    safety_score = 0
    
    # Check operation type
    if operation.type in SAFE_OPERATIONS:
        safety_score += 50
    elif operation.type in ESCALATION_REQUIRED:
        safety_score += 25
    else:
        safety_score += 0
    
    # Check service risk level
    service_risk = context.get_service_risk(operation.service)
    safety_score -= service_risk * 20
    
    # Check change impact
    impact = assess_change_impact(operation, context)
    safety_score -= impact * 15
    
    # Check recent failures
    recent_failures = get_recent_failures(operation.service)
    safety_score -= recent_failures * 10
    
    return min(100, max(0, safety_score))
```

## Agent Configuration

### Agent Descriptor

Each agent is defined by a descriptor file:

```yaml
# .agent/agent-descriptor.yaml
name: "catalog-agent"
type: "catalog"
version: "1.0.0"
description: "Manages service catalog operations"

capabilities:
  - "update_manifests"
  - "validate_entries"
  - "fix_common_issues"

constraints:
  max_operations_per_hour: 10
  max_services_per_operation: 5
  require_approval_for: ["major_updates", "schema_changes"]

safety_checks:
  - "service_health_check"
  - "dependency_validation"
  - "rollback_availability"

escalation_triggers:
  - "operation_failure_rate > 20%"
  - "service_health_degradation"
  - "security_violation_detected"

monitoring:
  log_level: "INFO"
  audit_all_operations: true
  performance_tracking: true
```

### Agent Registration

Agents are registered with the platform:

```bash
python scripts/register_agent.py --descriptor .agent/agent-descriptor.yaml
```

### Agent Authentication

Agents authenticate using:

- **API Keys**: For service-to-service communication
- **Certificates**: For secure agent authentication
- **OAuth Tokens**: For GitHub and other external services

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Factors

The platform evaluates multiple risk factors:

#### Service Risk Factors

- **Maturity Level**: Experimental services are higher risk
- **Quality Score**: Lower quality scores indicate higher risk
- **Recent Failures**: Services with recent failures are higher risk
- **Dependency Complexity**: Complex dependencies increase risk
- **Security Status**: Security issues increase risk

#### Change Risk Factors

- **Change Type**: Breaking changes are higher risk
- **Change Scope**: Changes affecting multiple services are higher risk
- **Change Frequency**: Frequent changes can indicate instability
- **Change Testing**: Untested changes are higher risk

#### Environmental Risk Factors

- **Time of Day**: Changes during business hours are higher risk
- **Day of Week**: Changes on weekdays are higher risk
- **Recent Incidents**: Recent platform incidents increase risk
- **Resource Availability**: Limited resources increase risk

### Risk Scoring

Risk scores are calculated using weighted factors:

```python
def calculate_risk_score(operation, context):
    risk_score = 0
    
    # Service risk (40% weight)
    service_risk = context.get_service_risk(operation.service)
    risk_score += service_risk * 0.4
    
    # Change risk (35% weight)
    change_risk = assess_change_risk(operation)
    risk_score += change_risk * 0.35
    
    # Environmental risk (25% weight)
    env_risk = assess_environmental_risk(context)
    risk_score += env_risk * 0.25
    
    return min(100, risk_score)
```

### Risk Thresholds

| Risk Level | Score Range | Action |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| **Low** | 0-30 | Automated execution |
| **Medium** | 31-60 | Automated with monitoring |
| **High** | 61-80 | Human approval required |
| **Critical** | 81-100 | Manual execution only |

## Monitoring and Auditing

### Audit Logging

All agent operations are logged with:

- **Operation Details**: What was performed
- **Context Information**: Platform state at time of operation
- **Risk Assessment**: Risk score and factors
- **Outcome**: Success or failure
- **Performance Metrics**: Execution time and resource usage

#### Audit Log Format

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-27T10:30:00Z",
  "agent_id": "catalog-agent-v1.0.0",
